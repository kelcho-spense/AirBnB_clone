# AirBnB_clone
## Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
## **The Console**
### This is the first step towards building full web application: the AirBnB clone
### The console will be a tool to that will enable us to manage the objects of the project.
	* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	* Update attributes of an object
	* Destroy an object
